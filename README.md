<h3 align="left">Project Overview 🚀</h3>

- 🛡️ **Prevent Data Tampering:** This project focuses on preventing data tampering during data transmission between the client and server, ensuring data integrity and security.
- 🔒 **Client-Side Encryption:** It utilizes the RSA encryption algorithm to perform client-side encryption of sensitive data.
- 💻 **Middleware Implementation:** The project is implemented as Django Middleware, making it seamless to integrate with Django-based web applications.
- 🌐 **Security Enhancement:** By encrypting data during transit, this project enhances security for important login/signup pages and sensitive information.
- 📜 **Open-Source:** This project is open-source and available for contributions and collaboration.

<h3 align="left">Key Features 🌟</h3>

- 🚀 **Client-Side Encryption:** Automatically sends encryption JavaScript code to the client for on-the-fly data encryption.
- 🛠️ **Middleware Integration:** Easy integration with Django-based web applications using middleware.
- 🔐 **Data Security:** Ensures data is encrypted during transmission, preventing unauthorized tampering.
- 📦 **Modular Design:** Well-structured codebase with a modular design for flexibility and customization.

<h3 align="left">How it Works 🔍</h3>

1. When a client requests an important login/signup page, the server responds with encryption JavaScript code.
2. The client uses this code for encryption when submitting data on the form.
3. Data is encrypted on the client-side before transmission, enhancing security.
4. Middleware ensures this process is seamless within the Django Framework.
